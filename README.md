# Exam Timetable Schedulier
Hello, I have used C Programming for this project.

### Problem Statement : Exam Timetable in a University
 TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TABLE FOR THE
UNVIERSITY EXAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS
WRITING THE EXAMS AND DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY
OF CLASSES.


### Input:
- File1 containing stundents , staff , room and course details.
- File2 containing arrear course details.
- Date,Time.


### Architectural Diagram:

### Technique:
- Sorting
- File system
- Modular programming / data encapsulation.
- Multiple aspects of same data.
- String initialization.
- Application of structure copy.
- Alternatives to “magic numbers” .
- Proper use of header files.


### Soft constraints addressed:
- A student should not have a more than one exam in a day.
- The Examination duration will not violate the assigned duration.
- In a room, students should be of the same department.
- Number of staffs can be higher than the required.

### Conclusion:
Scheduling and Planning are very common problems to all universities ,colleges and schools. It is difficult to generate a perfect timetable satisfying all the hard and soft constraints. Timetabling is the procedure of assigning classes to time-slots and classrooms, subjected to various
constraints. The ultimate aim of our project is to minimize the whole cost of resources used. Our primary goal of timetable scheduling process is minimization of the total conflicts in the timetable. In this project we have gone through different research work carried out by different researchers and referred various algorithms for solving the problem. Finally we generated an examination timetable for students including staff and arrear timetable.
