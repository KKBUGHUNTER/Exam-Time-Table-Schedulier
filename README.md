# Exam Timetable Schedulier
Hello, I have used C Program for this project.
### INTRODUCTION :
Examination timetable scheduling is a serious challenge in every University system with concerns on assigning examinations to venues over a period of time. Major challenges facing examination scheduling includes having studentâ€™s population to be much more
than the available resources, availability of examination venues for the examinations within limited time periods and satisfying all constraints is becoming increasingly difficult. Timetabling scheduling is defined as assigning examinations into a fixed number of timeslots hereby
satisfying all university constraints. However, for every institution the objective is to construct an effective and satisfactory examination timetable. An institutional timetable is said to be effective when it keep its users satisfied to a reasonable extent. The main motive of this project
is the complexity of satisfying the constraints in examination timetable which includes high time consumption and manpower, thereby being too stressful. However, the major objective of this study is to design an algorithm that performs all hard and soft constraints using optimization algorithm and local search techniques to produce an effective timetable feasible solution. In this report we are going to present an Architectural diagram / Block diagram describing the modules and its functions. The implementation of our algorithm and code has been included in this report. The results of our project outcome are illustrated including the input and output images
that satisfying the hard and soft constraints.


### Problem Statement : 
Exam Timetable in a University<br>
 TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TABLE FOR THE
UNVIERSITY EXAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS
WRITING THE EXAMS AND DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY
OF CLASSES.


### Input:
- File1 containing stundents , staff , room and course details.
- File2 containing arrear course details.
- Date,Time.
### Output:
- output have store in File as txt format 
 - Arrear Timetable.
 - Main Timetable
 - Student seating Timetable.
 - Invigilator Timetable.

### Architectural Diagram:

### Technique:
- Sorting
- File system
- Modular programming / data encapsulation.
- Multiple aspects of same data.
- String initialization.
- Application of structure copy.
- Proper use of header files.


### Soft constraints addressed:
- A student should not have a more than one exam in a day.
- The Examination duration will not violate the assigned duration.
- In a room, students should be of the same department.
- Number of staffs can be higher than the required.

### Conclusion:
Scheduling and Planning are very common problems to all universities ,colleges and schools. It is difficult to generate a perfect timetable satisfying all the hard and soft constraints. Timetabling is the procedure of assigning classes to time-slots and classrooms, subjected to various
constraints. The ultimate aim of our project is to minimize the whole cost of resources used. Our primary goal of timetable scheduling process is minimization of the total conflicts in the timetable. In this project we have gone through different research work carried out by different researchers and referred various algorithms for solving the problem. Finally we generated an examination timetable for students including staff and arrear timetable.
